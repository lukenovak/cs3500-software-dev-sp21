# Milestone 6 - Refactoring Report

**Team members:** William "Rigby" Victoria, Luke "Mordecai" Novak

**Github team/repo:** https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-S21/Ormegland


## Plan

Prior to this milestone, we already identified a number of github issues outstanding with our codebase, and we
will be tackling those. Our first priority will be lining up our level representation with the JSON input and
output that represents a level. This input and output is currently represented in row/column form, but our
internal representation works in the opposite way (cartesian coordinates). Beyond that, we would like to introduce
more local functions to cut down on duplicate code and decrease the overall size to our codebase.


## Changes

TODO: Complete this section after the changes have been made.


## Future Work

If we have extra time, we would also like to improve our rendering. Doing this would require some playing around
with the Fyne library that we are currently using to render our UI, but will make testing game development easier
as we get further into the development process.


## Conclusion

We are taking a *bit* of a down week this week in terms of work load however we have identified a number of
areas that need work, and we will be improving these areas.
