## Local snarl

To run the game, type in `./snarl` with the options you would like to select.

The game will boot up in the command line and open a number of GUI windows depending
on the number of players you have selected. To move the player, use the arrow keys in
the command line to select a move. Once you have selected your move, hit ENTER to send
the move to the game server. If it is valid, the game will move the player and update
their position. If it is not valid, the game will tell you the move is invalid and ask
you for another move.
